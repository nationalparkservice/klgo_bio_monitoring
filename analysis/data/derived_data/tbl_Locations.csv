After surveying this section, walk across the gravel beach immediately to the north of Yakutania Point and up onto the large rock outcrop. From the top of the rock outcrop, survey the rest of the shoreline and small cove not visible from the point. This completes this section of the survey."

Directly kiddy-corner from this pullout there is a small pullout (actually just a small widening of the road) on the west side of the road approximately 30m north. Park here and walk down a fairly steep embankment to the shoreline. There is a large flat rock exposed during low tide just to the south that provides a good vantage point of the upper Inlet. The observer may also pick another suitable vantage point if the rock slab is not accessible. Survey the triangle formed by a northeast line beginning on the west shore directly across from the trespass cabin demarcated by a rock outcrop on the west shore where a section of rock has fallen away revealing reddish-toned rock beneath to the southwest corner of the Taiya River mouth. This observation point gives a good view of the head of the Inlet.


Drive north along the Inlet from the pullout looking for birds along the shoreline below that was not visible from the last observation point. Continue past a large pullout on the west side of the road above the mouth of the river to several small pullouts (actually just small widenings of the road) on the west past the last shrubs that block the view. Survey the mouth of the river from here. The determination of the mouth of the river will depend on the tide.

The end of this section is upstream to the point where the river starts to curve to the west in a large S-curve and a vegetated cut-bank begins on the west bank. Toward the end of the S-curve, a higher-benched cut-bank begins.

From here, walk along the east side of the creek to its mouth surveying the creek as well as the flats. Survey the triangle at the head of the Inlet formed by a line beginning at a rock outcrop on the west shore where a section of rock has fallen away revealing reddish-toned rock beneath directly across from the derelict trespass cabin on the eastern shore to the southwest corner of the Taiya River mouth. If the upper Inlet was surveyed at low tide, most birds except dabblers near the creek mouth will have been counted.

Continue walking the shoreline east of the creek mouth along the beach dunes in a wide circle back to the parking area. Dabbling ducks in this section will be flighty, so it is best to get counts from a distance before birds are flushed. This completes this section."

It is also best to survey this section at low tide when the birds are concentrated.

Begin by parking at the small pullout next to a rock promontory on the west side of the road at Mile 7. Walk south along the road approximately 30m to the side road on the west. Walk down the side road a short distance to a gate and then walk out to the edge of the ridge along the Inlet. Follow the ridge south about 20m to a large open rock outcrop with the remains of a large old wooden tripod probably used as a boom or hoist of some kind. This is the primary observation point for this section. Begin the survey from an east-west line directly across from the southernmost visible point on the east shore (i.e., the next point north of Dyea Point). Survey the upper Inlet to an east-west line directly across from the derelict trespass cabin. This point is roughly demarcated by a rock outcrop on the west shore where a section of rock has fallen away revealing reddish-toned rock beneath.

Survey the east shore that is not visible from the tripod for this section from the rock promontory at the parking pullout. This completes this section of the survey."

Continue walking along the east dock to the end looking down each slip sequentially (make sure to look for gulls on the tops of poles). Turn right and continue to the end of the south dock to the harbor entrance. From there, turn around and walk ack and up the south ramp and out onto the harbor breakwall to near the end. Scan the outer harbor area to just beyond the east ship dock where the shoreline curves inward and disappears from view (make sure to look for waterfowl beneath the dock amongst the pilings).

When finished, walk back along Congress Way around the harbor to the State Ferry Terminal parking lot. From there, walk around the north end of the ship harbor scanning beneath the pilings and then back along the west sidewalk south to the northwest corner of the Ferry Terminal. Scan the rest of the outer harbor area out parallel to Yakutania Point. Then, take a quick walk around the Terminal out onto the Ferry dock.

Next, walk back up Broadway and take the sidewalk along the railroad tracks northwest to the Skagway River foot bridge that goes to Yakutania Point. Survey up river to the end of the airport runway and downstream to the mouth (look for shorebirds on the east side of the river below Temsco Helicopters where there is a small tidal wetland area). Continue walking across the foot bridge and down the foot path toward Yakutania Point. Where the path turns right to go to Yakutania Point, continue straight ahead out onto the rocky point on the west side of the river. This gives a good view of the river mouth and the small beach area to the north. This completes this section of the survey.
