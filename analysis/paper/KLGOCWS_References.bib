abstract = {The National Park Service has developed a long-term ecological monitoring program for 32 ecoregional networks containing more than 270 parks with significant natural resources. The monitoring program assists park managers in developing a broad-based understanding of the status and trends of park resources as a basis for making decisions and working with other agencies and the public for the long-term protection of park ecosystems. We found that the basic steps involved in planning and designing a long-term ecological monitoring program were the same for a range of ecological systems including coral reefs, deserts, arctic tundra, prairie grasslands, caves, and tropical rainforests. These steps involve (1) clearly defining goals and objectives, (2) compiling and summarizing existing information, (3) developing conceptual models, (4) prioritizing and selecting indicators, (5) developing an overall sampling design, (6) developing monitoring protocols, and (7) establishing data management, analysis, and reporting procedures. The broad-based, scientifically sound information obtained through this systems-based monitoring program will have multiple applications for management decision-making, research, education, and promoting public understanding of park resources. When combined with an effective education program, monitoring results can contribute not only to park issues, but also to larger quality-of-life issues that affect surrounding communities and can contribute significantly to the environmental health of the nation.},

abstract = {Long-term research and monitoring can provide important ecological insights and are crucial for the improved management of ecosystems and natural resources. However, many long-term research and monitoring programs are either ineffective or fail completely owing to poor planning and/or lack of focus. Here we propose the paradigm of adaptive monitoring, which aims to resolve many of the problems that have undermined previous attempts to establish long-term research and monitoring. This paradigm is driven by tractable questions, rigorous statistical design at the outset, a conceptual model of the ecosystem or other entity being examined and a human need to know about ecosystem change. An adaptive monitoring framework enables monitoring programs to evolve iteratively as new information emerges and research questions change.},

abstract = {Management decisions all too often are based on data of unknown reliability – that is, from research conducted using biased methods, low sample sizes, and inappropriate analyses.{\ldots}The general dearth of monitoring, validation, and adaptive management research forces a vicious cycle. This does not need to – and should not – persist. (Morrison et al. 2006: xix) Introduction Developing a monitoring program requires a chain of decisions, many complex, about a variety of issues. These decisions deal with questions ranging from policy and management (“What information is required to decide among the feasible actions?”) to the science of the system under study (“What is the best indicator of the ecological process of interest, and what is the best measurement protocol for that attribute?”) to purely statistical (“How much effort will it take to estimate a parameter with a precision of ±10{\%} of its true value?”). This variety of challenging questions implicitly encourages compartmentalization and isolation in decision making. However, this compartmentalized approach can lead to suboptimal and even counterproductive decisions. Instead, a “whole-problem” perspective helps us see that all of the necessary decisions interact to influence the quality and cost of the monitoring program's ultimate product, information (Box 2.1). A whole-problem perspective reveals that statistical considerations permeate the monitoring process. Information quality, a key measure of a monitoring program{\^{a}}€™s effectiveness, inherently entails consideration of the statistical concepts of bias and uncertainty (Box 2.2). Bias and uncertainty are controlled and accounted for through statistical methods of survey design, measurement, and analysis. Most importantly, effectively incorporating these statistical methods into the broader monitoring program requires statistical thinking to see how each source of bias and variability ultimately impacts information quality and cost and to identify where to allocate resources among the many program components to most efficiently improve information quality (Hooke 1980, Snee 1990, Chance 2002, Hoerl and Snee 2010). {\textcopyright} Cambridge University Press 2012.},

@article{Wu2018,
abstract = {Birds in U.S. national parks find strong protection from many longstanding and pervasive threats, but remain highly exposed to effects of ongoing climate change. To understand how climate change is likely to alter bird communities in parks, we used species distribution models relating North American Breeding Bird Survey (summer) and Audubon Christmas Bird Count (winter) observations to climate data from the early 2000s and projected to 2041–2070 (hereafter, mid-century) under high and low greenhouse gas concentration trajectories, RCP8.5 and RCP2.6. We analyzed climate suitability projections over time for 513 species across 274 national parks, classifying them as improving, worsening, stable, potential colonization, and potential extirpation. U.S. national parks are projected to become increasingly important for birds in the coming decades as potential colonizations exceed extirpations in 62–100{\%} of parks, with an average ratio of potential colonizations to extirpations of 4.1 in winter and 1.4 in summer under RCP8.5. Average species turnover is 23{\%} in both summer and winter under RCP8.5. Species turnover (Bray-Curtis) and potential colonization and extirpation rates are positively correlated with latitude in the contiguous 48 states. Parks in the Midwest and Northeast are expected to see particularly high rates of change. All patterns are more extreme under RCP8.5 than under RCP2.6. Based on the ratio of potential colonization and extirpation, parks were classified into overall trend groups associated with specific climate-informed conservation strategies. Substantial change to bird and ecological communities is anticipated in coming decades, and current thinking suggests managing towards a forward-looking concept of ecological integrity that accepts change and novel ecological conditions, rather than focusing management goals exclusively on maintaining or restoring a static set of historical conditions.
